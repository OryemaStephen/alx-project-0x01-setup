# Project 1

This project is a comprehensive Next.js web application that demonstrates fundamental concepts of modern web development. The application features multiple pages for displaying posts and users, with interactive components for adding new content. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js, the project showcases best practices in component-based architecture, state management, and API integration.

## 📘 Project Description

This project provides a hands-on learning experience by building a simplified Airbnb-style application. It covers the foundational tools and technologies required to create modern, responsive web interfaces using:

- **React** for component-based architecture
- **Next.js** for routing and performance optimization
- **TypeScript** for static typing and developer tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling

- Understand how to scaffold a Next.js project with TypeScript
- Learn the folder structure and organization best practices in Next.js
- Implement basic routing using the Pages Router
- Create reusable React components with TypeScript
- Work with TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Manage assets and static files effectively in Next.js
- Master component composition and separation of concerns
- Apply responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS
- Set up and configure ESLint for code quality enforcement

---

## ✅ Requirements

Make sure the following tools are installed before getting started:

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE)
- Next.js v13+

## 💡 Best Practices

### 📁 Project Structure
- Components are stored in a dedicated `components` directory.
- TypeScript interfaces are centralized in an `interfaces` directory.
- Pages follow Next.js conventions in the `pages` directory.

### 🧩 Component Design
- Components are typed using TypeScript interfaces.
- Components are reusable and accept props for customization.
- Each component focuses on a single responsibility for modularity.

### 🧹 Code Quality
- ESLint is configured to ensure consistent and clean code.
- TypeScript is used for type safety and better IntelliSense.
- Arrow functions are used consistently across components.

### 🎨 Styling
- Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first, responsive styling.
- Layouts respect consistent spacing and typography scales.

### ⚡ Performance
- Next.js `Image` component is used for optimized image rendering.
- Code splitting and lazy loading are handled automatically.
- Only essential dependencies are included to keep the bundle size minimal.
